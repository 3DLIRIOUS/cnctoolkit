The archive contains 8 scripts to assist with spline work for CNC_Toolkit processing.  They are mostly macro scripts.. i.e designed to run off buttons in the GUI.  

To install, extract the bundle and copy the files to your gmax directory.. using the same file locations as applied in the extracted archive.  

Theres a MaxStart.cui file in the ui directory... this should load all the script buttons onto a toolbar in your gmax gui... however, if you have customised the gmax GUI to suit your own needs, be sure to back up your own 'MaxStart.cui' file FIRST !!!

Some of these scripts require instructions.. they should show a tool-tip description in the GUI.  I'll create explanations for usage when I get time... some are self-explanatory.. like the CNC_Toolkit launcher.. bitmaptomodels is described in the ebook.

The others will be covered in the update....
